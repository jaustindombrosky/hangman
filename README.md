# hangman

This is a project we made in my University of Utah Coding Bootcamp.  It was my first attempt at Javascript and originally
I had made my project with jquery which proved difficult because we had not yet been taught it.  I finished the game and 
decided to attempt the same project in vanilla javascript to better understand the concepts. vanilla .js and .html are linked
to the same .css as the first project.
